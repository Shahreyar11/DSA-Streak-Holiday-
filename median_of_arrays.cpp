// HERE WE HAVE TO FIND OUT MEDIAN OF TWO SORTED ARRAYS
// A1 = {10,20,30,40,50}
// A2 = {5,15,25,35,45}
//{5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50}


// Median = 27.5 as total 10(even) elements taken middle both elements 25 and 30 add and divided by 2 

// from median left side of all the elemtns will be smaller than the median element and right side will be greater
