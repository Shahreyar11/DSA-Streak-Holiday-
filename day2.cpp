        }
    }
}

// So In this optimal code 
// Every recursive call reduces the problem size by half.

// Therefore, the number of calls will be logâ‚‚(n)
// (Because you can divide n by 2 about logâ‚‚(n) times.)

// AND SPACE COMPLEXITY 
// ðŸ”¥ What happens?
// Each time we call firstOccur(), it adds one function call on the call stack.

// Since we cut problem size by half each time, the maximum depth of recursion is also log n.

// ðŸ“Œ So:
// Space Complexity = O(log n)
// (due to recursion stack)
